/*

Objective:
You will practice creating and combining boolean expressions
to drive logic and outcomes in you program.

Instructions:
If you are not familiar with the concept of a text-based adventure game,
let's set the scene...
Example: "You wake up in a dark forest. There are two paths ahead of you:
one leading to the mountains and one to a village.
Your choices will determine your fate!"

Define the Requirements: You must:
  - Write conditional statements to handle player choices.
  - Use boolean expressions to combine multiple conditions.
  - Include at least one use of logical operators (&&, ||, !).

Starter Code:
  - Run the following command in your terminal to install the readline-sync module:
    npm install readline-sync

Paste the following code into your editor:

*/

const readline = require('readline-sync');

// Player state / inventory (start values)
let hasTorch = true;
let hasMap = false;
let hasSword = false;
let hasCompass = false;
let gold = 5; // small amount to buy items
let health = 10;

console.log("Welcome to the Adventure of Boolean Forks!");
console.log("Your choices will determine your fate. Inventory: torch, map, sword, compass.");

// Helper to normalize input
function ask(prompt, autoValue) {
  if (process.env.AUTO_PLAY === '1') {
    // In automated mode, return the provided autoValue (string) so the script can be tested non-interactively
    console.log(prompt + " " + `(auto: ${autoValue})`);
    return autoValue;
  }
  const ans = readline.question(prompt + " ");
  return ans.trim().toLowerCase();
}

// Show inventory
function showInventory() {
  console.log("-- Inventory --");
  console.log(`Torch: ${hasTorch}, Map: ${hasMap}, Sword: ${hasSword}, Compass: ${hasCompass}, Gold: ${gold}, Health: ${health}`);

/* 

Add Customization and expand the game:
  - Add more choices and scenarios.
  - Include additional items (e.g., a sword, a compass).
  - Use nested conditionals and logical operators to create complex outcomes.
